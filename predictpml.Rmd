Choosing Predictor Variables
Because of the number of variables (160, the model was taking too long to build and so we decided to use the data that had complete data. These included belt, arm, dumbbell and forearms)

For more information about the dataset go here >> http://groupware.les.inf.puc-rio.br/work.jsf?p1=11201

Here are the predictor variables selected


removeMissingData <- sapply(testing, function (x) any(is.na(x) | x == ""))
definingPredictorVariables <- !removeMissingData & grepl("belt|[^(fore)]arm|dumbbell|forearm", names(removeMissingData))
PredictorVariables <- names(removeMissingData)[definingPredictorVariables]

Build the model
The model uses k-mode cross validation and is run 3 times on 10-fold data starting with 70% of the data for training and 30% for validating the model.



Below the accuracy will test the prediction accuracy derived from the training data against the validation data



nuFoldData <- 10
nuRepeats <- 3
testDataSize <- 0.7
base <- read.csv("data/pml-training.csv")
tempTraining <- createDataPartition(base$classe, p = testDataSize, list = FALSE)
training <- base[tempTraining,]
validation <- base[-tempTraining,]




#Using all variables

Predicting events using testing data
Letâ€™s test our data using the test data given above
nuPredictions <- 20
finalData <- rep(NA, nuPredictions)
for(i in 1:nuPredictions){
  tmpID <- filter(testing, problem_id == i)
  finalData[i] <- as.vector(predict(trainedModel, newdata = tmpID))
}
